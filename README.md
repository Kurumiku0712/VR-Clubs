## Abstract
This project focuses on developing a VR system aimed at university societies. Utilizing Unity3D for scene construction and functionality, along with HTC Vive for immersive interaction, the system aims to create an engaging virtual club experience. By leveraging virtual reality technology, the project integrates social elements and detailed functional modules to emphasize immersion. The system includes several club activity scenes built with Blender, C# scripting for interaction, and uses SteamVR and VRTK for real-time rendering and interaction. The HTC Vive setup with Lighthouse technology provides an intuitive and realistic immersive space for users.

## Introduction
With the rapid development of related technologies, "metaverse" has become a highly discussed concept. The metaverse represents both a parallel world closely related to reality and an independent virtual space that grows more realistic over time. The global COVID-19 pandemic has increased the time people spend in virtual spaces, leading to a greater demand for online digital environments. Technologies such as AI, XR, big data, blockchain, cloud computing, and digital twin systems have all contributed to the rise of the metaverse concept.

Since mid-2021, the term metaverse has gained significant attention. Despite the industry's strong interest and investment in the metaverse, academic research is still in its early stages. This project aims to construct a university life metaverse, focusing on the design and implementation of an immersive VR system that integrates university social life. Users can experience the advantages of the virtual world through VR devices, enhancing their university life experience.

## VR Technology and Development Environment
Virtual Reality (VR) technology simulates a three-dimensional virtual world, providing users with visual and auditory experiences that make them feel as if they are in the environment. VR technology features immersion, interactivity, and imagination.

### HTC Vive Device Overview
HTC Vive is a VR headset developed by HTC and Valve. It includes a head-mounted display, controllers, and Lighthouse tracking system. The Lighthouse technology uses infrared signals for precise tracking of the headset and controllers.

### VR Environment Setup
Setting up the VR environment involves configuring HTC Vive hardware and software. The software setup includes using SteamVR SDK for device management and VRTK for implementing VR interactions. The combination of Unity, SteamVR, and VRTK supports the development of immersive VR experiences.

### Development Tools
The development environment includes:
- Unity 2019.4.11f1
- SteamVR SDK
- VRTK (Virtual Reality Toolkit)
- Visual Studio 2019
- Blender (for 3D modeling)
- RenderDoc (for graphic debugging)

By leveraging these tools and technologies, this project aims to create a comprehensive and immersive VR system for university societies, enhancing the social interaction experience in a virtual environment.
